# RickSploit
Let's get those wannabe hackers rickrolled with RickSploit

# What's this?
This package rickrolls wannabe hackers who wanted to install metasploit on termux,

With this package, it disguised as metasploit and simulates the Installation of rubygems and discards them to `/dev/null` and it only takes few dependencies

After Installation, it will usually have commands like `msfconsole`, `msfvenom` however it only does opening YouTube to play rickroll and redirects user to Termux FAQ page
# Why?
In order to comply termux's purpose, we respect the usage of termux and to avoid making termux community as *Hacker's Paradise* and not to mislead new users to treat termux as hacking which includes Tool-X, Saycheese and so on 

*I might even rickroll Tool-X, Zphisher or Say cheese* 😬

I hope this tool doesn't affect users who wanted to become IT Security

See [FAQ Page](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/FAQ#Where_are_Metasploit_and_Hydra_packages) for more info

# Building
Git clone this repository
```
https://github.com/WMCB-Tech/RickSploit
```

And run `./build-deb.sh` to generate rickrolled metasploit debfile after you made some modifications

# How to install metasploit?
Well for sake of my decision, i would say, install a distribution and install metasploit there, or compile it on your own

I may not provide actual metasploit package and this is just a joke package
